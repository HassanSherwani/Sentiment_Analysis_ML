# Sentiment_Analysis_ML
Sentiment analysis is the automated process of understanding an opinion about a given subject from written or spoken language.

Sentiment Analysis also known as Opinion Mining is a field within Natural Language Processing (NLP) that builds systems that try to identify and extract opinions within text. Usually, besides identifying the opinion, these systems extract attributes of the expression e.g.:

Polarity: if the speaker express a positive or negative opinion,
Subject: the thing that is being talked about,
Opinion holder: the person, or entity that expresses the opinion.
